at least 4 dimensions
At least three measures per fact table (healthy range is 3–6).
• At least one measure per fact table must be fully additive across time and other dimensions (e.g.,
counts, costs, volumes).
• Semi-additive measures are optional but welcome (e.g., averages, ratios, scores).


hierarchy levels in dim tables?

At least one conformed (shared) dimension used by both fact tables (besides time).
• At least two dimensions must include three levels of hierarchy each (and each fact must use at
least one such dimension).
• At most one Slowly Changing Dimension of Type 2 (SCD2).
• At most one degenerate dimension is allowed (justify in 1–2 sentences).
• At most one junk dimension is allowed (counts as a single dimension even if it consolidates
multiple attributes).

Create your dimensional/fact tables by executing appropriate DDL statements. Create dimensions
first, then facts. Include an audit column (etl_load_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) in every dimension and fact table to mimic production load tracking.
Do not create tables manually outside the ETL - table creation must be part of your pipeline

- 1 fact, 3 dimensions each
